# IPL_webscraping

**Description:** Being a massive cricket fan I ventured out to analyze and visualize how IPL 2023 teams are composed and what kind of players garnered the most attention during the auction. The data for the project was collected via web scraping with help of Selenium and it was stored in a Google Sheet with the help of Google Sheet API. Data included overall available T20 record and not just IPL record for each player and later visualized using Tableau.

**Skills:** Data Visualization, Data Collection, Data Cleaning

**Technology:** Selenium (Python), Google Sheet API, Tableau
